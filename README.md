# Replication_Sannikov_2008

This study replicates the continuous-time principal–agent model of Sannikov (2008). We formulate the incentive-compatible optimal contracting problem with moral hazard in infinite horizon and solve it numerically using an implicit finite-difference method applied to the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The replication confirms the original model’s results for the baseline case (optimal retirement of the agent at an endogenously determined threshold) and demonstrates how outcomes change when the agent can quit, be replaced at a cost, or be trained (promoted) to higher productivity. Under each scenario, we compute the principal’s value function and optimal effort and consumption policies.
